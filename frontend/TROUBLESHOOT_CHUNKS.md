# Troubleshooting Chunk Loading Errors

If you see errors like:
```
Loading failed for the <script> with source "http://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/main-app.js"
```

## Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - **Chrome/Edge:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - **Firefox:** Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open DevTools (F12), right-click the refresh button, select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Clear browser cache completely:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
   - Click "Clear site data" or "Clear storage"
   - Refresh the page

3. **If that doesn't work, restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   cd frontend
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check if server is running:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i:3000
   ```
   You should see a Node.js process.

5. **Verify chunks are being generated:**
   ```bash
   ls -la frontend/.next/static/chunks/ | grep main-app
   ```

## Common Causes:

- **Browser cache** serving old chunk references (most common)
- **Dev server not fully started** - wait a few seconds after starting
- **Stale .next cache** - delete `.next` folder and restart
- **Port conflict** - another process using port 3000

## The chunks are dynamically generated by Next.js in dev mode, so they may take a moment to appear after server start.
